<h2> All about me!</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Maggie Hauser. I am a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am a sophomore pursuing a degree in Consumer Behavior and Marketplace Studies. I am also double minoring in Digital Studies and Entrepreneurship. I also love dogs and animals. I have two King Charles Cavalier Spaniels. Their names are Owen and Reggie. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family and friends! A fun fact about me is that I was the captain of my high school's bowling team!</p>
